* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Usage

Setup project ```npm install```

Run tests: `npm run test`

Run start: `npm run start`

### Start the application

That would launch an web application on port `8080` by default, if you're running into port conflict, just modify the port in `src/index.js` or stop the existing application one on `8080`.

After the launch, you could access the application via sending http requests to the following endpoint.
for local use:
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/productos/busqueda
